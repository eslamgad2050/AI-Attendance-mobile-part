![Project](https://github.com/AI-Attendance/Project-Overview/assets/51399509/67640ad0-5abe-4e44-99b8-ca3c96e57303)

The project aims to develop a smart attendance system that uses AI technology to recognize faces, and integrates a database, a mobile app, and a web app.


## mobile_app

mobile app used to assign the employee attendence when he is out of the company location  
* Some employees are allowed to register their attendance through a mobile application provided that they register themselves at specific locations determined by the admin.
* The employee can register his attendance or leave at the allowed times and within a certain distance of the location registered for them.
* When he takes a selfie, the photo is sent to the AI server to verify that the id used in the app is the exact one that is linked to the employee in the image. The location and times are validated as well.
* Finally, the attendance can be viewed from the employee's page or the admin's logs in the web application.
